# kAntiCheat - PocketMine-MP 2.0.0

A simple anticheat plugin.

Currently, this plugin only has two functions: limiting CPS and the distance a player can reach.

You can configure everything in config.yml

```yaml
# Maximum distance that one player can hit another.
# By default, the player can hit targets at a distance of 4 blocks.
# However, I would recommend leaving a lower value.
max_hit_distance: 3

# Delay between one hit and another. For example, 0.25 => 4 hits per second.
delay_per_hit: 0.25
```

More updates coming soon (it all depends on my laziness)
